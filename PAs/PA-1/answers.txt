Does this trend make sense?
- Yes the trend of the execution time increasing as file size increases makes sense. The smaller files are floored a little since there is 
    some time it takes for the client and server to startup. After this though, we can see the larger files take more time as they get bigger.

What is the bottleneck that stops the code from transferring files faster?
- The main bottleneck that is stopping the transfers from being faster is the buffer size. Each read and write can only be as big as the buffer size.
    So for bigger files it takes more time since we must perform more read and writes.
